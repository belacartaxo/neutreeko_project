# Neutreeko_Game
This project was developed for the EIACD (Elements of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science) course, led by Professor Luis Paulo Reis.
The game Neutreeko was created by Jan Kristian Haugland and can be accessed [here](https://www.neutreeko.net/neutreeko.htm).

The objective of the game is to align three pieces in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
Players can only move to the furthest available position in those directions.
A draw is declared when the board configuration repeats itself three times.

## Description

The aim of this project was to develop a game algorithm that simulates Neutreeko and employs search methods, thereby enhancing our coding expertise through the implementation and evaluation of AI models like Minimax and Negamax.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

**Python**
**Pygame**
**NumPy**

#### Used libraries
